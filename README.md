# react-horizon
Trying to make React and Horizon work together the way we would use React and ES2015 if we did not had horizon. Wish me luck!

## Dependencies
1. horizon.io
2. node.js
3. RethinkDB
4. Webpack (installed globally

## Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Danilo-Zekovic/react-horizon.git
cd react-horizon
cd rh
npm install
webpack
hz serve --dev
```

Then go to localhost:8181    

Also now this comands work too:     

To build the bundle.js:     
```npm run build```     
To rebuild automatically every time some change is saved:    
```npm run watch```    
To run the server:    
```npm start```      

Still working on the server-dev:
